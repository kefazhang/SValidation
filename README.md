SValidation: A Generative Model-Based Framework for Structural Variant Validation via Genomic Image Representations

SValidation is a deep learning-based framework designed to validate structural variants (SVs) detected from long-read sequencing data. It leverages genomic image representation and applies a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to denoise repetitive background patterns. By enhancing true structural features and effectively removing noise caused by highly repetitive genomic regions, SValidation enables more accurate SV boundary localization and classification.
